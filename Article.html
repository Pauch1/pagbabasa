    <p>Pasig City RTC Branch 167 Judge Annielyn Medes-Cabelis issued the order on September 19, 2024, which was obtained by Rappler on Friday, September 20. The judge stated:</p>
    
    <p class="quote">"After examining the five (5) Informations, the resolution, and all the documents presented during the Preliminary Investigation, the Court finds probable cause to hold accused Alice Leal Guo....for trial for the crime/s charged against them."</p>
    
    <p>The judge ordered that the "corresponding warrant of arrest be issued" against Guo and 15 others, including the former mayor's Chinese business partners. One of the named individuals is Huang Zhiyang, alleged to be the big boss of POGOs (Philippine offshore gaming operations).</p>
    
    <p>Included in the order is Dennis Cunanan, the former chief of the state agency Technology and Livelihood Resource Center, who acted as a consultant for both the POGO in Bamban, Tarlac, and the POGO in Porac, Pampanga â€” both of which were raided after complaints of trafficking and torture.</p>

    <p>The charges stem from an investigation into land leased to the Hongsheng POGO. The case highlights ongoing concerns about the operations of offshore gaming in the Philippines and related criminal activities.</p>
    
    <p>This development marks a significant step in the legal proceedings against Guo and her associates, underlining the government's efforts to combat trafficking and illegal gambling operations in the country.</p>
